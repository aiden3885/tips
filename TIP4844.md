## Abstract
Introduce a new transaction format for "blob-carrying transactions" which contain a large amount of data that cannot be
accessed by TVN execution, but whose commitment can be accessed. Introduce a new opcode to get versioned hashes and add a precomile that verifies a KZG proof which claims that a blob (represented by a commitment) evaluates to a given value at a given point.


## Motivation
In order to be compatible with EVM's opcodes set, introduce a new opcode `BLOBHASH`  and a precompile `Point_Evaluation_Precompile` according to [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844) standard. EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, serves as a crucial interim solution for scaling Ethereum. It significantly reduces gas fees, especially for rollup solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, by up to 100 to 1000 times. By introducing a new transaction type called blob-carrying transaction, EIP-4844 allows large chunks of data, known as blobs, to be temporarily stored on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Tron also needs to introduce this blob transaction type to support BLOBHASH opcode along with other benefits, such as the Blob mechanism of EIP-4844, which can temporarily store large amounts of data in the TRON network without the need for permanent storage in the TRON main chain state. It also increases the feasibility of Tron's future support for layer2 expansion solutions.

### Cryptographic Helpers

Throughout this proposal we use cryptographic methods and classes defined in the corresponding [consensus 4844 specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/86fb82b221474cc89387fa6436806507b3849d88/specs/deneb).

Specifically, we use the following methods from [`polynomial-commitments.md`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/86fb82b221474cc89387fa6436806507b3849d88/specs/deneb/polynomial-commitments.md):

- [`verify_kzg_proof()`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/86fb82b221474cc89387fa6436806507b3849d88/specs/deneb/polynomial-commitments.md#verify_kzg_proof)
- [`verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch()`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/86fb82b221474cc89387fa6436806507b3849d88/specs/deneb/polynomial-commitments.md#verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch)

### Helpers

```python
def kzg_to_versioned_hash(commitment: KZGCommitment) -> VersionedHash:
    return VERSIONED_HASH_VERSION_KZG + sha256(commitment)[1:]
```

Approximates `factor * e ** (numerator / denominator)` using Taylor expansion:


```python
def fake_exponential(factor: int, numerator: int, denominator: int) -> int:
    i = 1
    output = 0
    numerator_accum = factor * denominator
    while numerator_accum > 0:
        output += numerator_accum
        numerator_accum = (numerator_accum * numerator) // (denominator * i)
        i += 1
    return output // denominator
```

### Blob transaction

We introduce a new contract type, "BlobContract".
```
enum ContractType {
    ...
    BlobContract = 60;
}
```

And the data structure of `BlobContract` is:

```
message BlobContract {
    message BlobTxSidecar {
        repeated bytes blobs = 1;
        repeated bytes commitments = 2;
        repeated bytes proofs = 3;
    }
    bytes owner_address = 1;
    bytes contract_address = 2;
    int64 call_value = 3;
    bytes data = 4;
    int64 call_token_value = 5;
    int64 token_id = 6;
    repeated BlobTxSidecar sidecar = 7; //blob data
    int64 blobFreeCap = 8; // maxFeePerBlobGas
    repeated bytes blobHashes = 9; 
}
```

### Header extension

The current header encoding is extended with two new 64-bit unsigned integer fields:

- `blob_gas_used` is the total amount of blob gas consumed by the transactions within the block.
- `excess_blob_gas` is a running total of blob gas consumed in excess of the target, prior to the block. Blocks with above-target blob gas consumption increase this value, blocks with below-target blob gas consumption decrease it (bounded at 0).

The resulting block header is therefore:

```
message BlockHeader {
  message raw {
    int64 timestamp = 1;
    bytes txTrieRoot = 2;
    bytes parentHash = 3;
    //bytes nonce = 5;
    //bytes difficulty = 6;
    int64 number = 7;
    int64 witness_id = 8;
    bytes witness_address = 9;
    int32 version = 10;
    bytes accountStateRoot = 11;
    int64 blobGasUsed = 12;
    int64 excessBlobGas = 13;
  }
  raw raw_data = 1;
  bytes witness_signature = 2;
}
```

The value of `excess_blob_gas` can be calculated using the parent header.

```python
def calc_excess_blob_gas(parent: Header) -> int:
    if parent.excess_blob_gas + parent.blob_gas_used < TARGET_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK:
        return 0
    else:
        return parent.excess_blob_gas + parent.blob_gas_used - TARGET_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK
```

For the first post-fork block, both `parent.blob_gas_used` and `parent.excess_blob_gas` are evaluated as `0`.

### Gas accounting

We introduce blob gas as a new type of gas. It is independent of normal gas and follows its own targeting rule.
We use the `excess_blob_gas` header field to store persistent data needed to compute the blob gas base fee. For now, only blobs are priced in blob gas.

```python
def calc_blob_fee(header: Header, tx: Transaction) -> int:
    return get_total_blob_gas(tx) * get_base_fee_per_blob_gas(header)

def get_total_blob_gas(tx: Transaction) -> int:
    return GAS_PER_BLOB * len(tx.blob_versioned_hashes)

def get_base_fee_per_blob_gas(header: Header) -> int:
    return fake_exponential(
        MIN_BASE_FEE_PER_BLOB_GAS,
        header.excess_blob_gas,
        BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION
    )
```

The block validity conditions are modified to include blob gas checks (see the [Execution layer validation](#execution-layer-validation) section below).

The actual `blob_fee` as calculated via `calc_blob_fee` is deducted from the sender balance before transaction execution and burned, and is not refunded in case of transaction failure.


### Opcode to get versioned hashes

We add an instruction `BLOBHASH` (with opcode `HASH_OPCODE_BYTE`) which reads `index` from the top of the stack
as big-endian `uint256`, and replaces it on the stack with `tx.blob_versioned_hashes[index]`
if `index < len(tx.blob_versioned_hashes)`, and otherwise with a zeroed `bytes32` value.
The opcode has a gas cost of `HASH_OPCODE_GAS`.


### Point evaluation precompile

Add a precompile at `POINT_EVALUATION_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS` that verifies a KZG proof which claims that a blob
(represented by a commitment) evaluates to a given value at a given point.

The precompile costs `POINT_EVALUATION_PRECOMPILE_GAS` and executes the following logic:

```python
def point_evaluation_precompile(input: Bytes) -> Bytes:
    """
    Verify p(z) = y given commitment that corresponds to the polynomial p(x) and a KZG proof.
    Also verify that the provided commitment matches the provided versioned_hash.
    """
    # The data is encoded as follows: versioned_hash | z | y | commitment | proof | with z and y being padded 32 byte big endian values
    assert len(input) == 192
    versioned_hash = input[:32]
    z = input[32:64]
    y = input[64:96]
    commitment = input[96:144]
    proof = input[144:192]

    # Verify commitment matches versioned_hash
    assert kzg_to_versioned_hash(commitment) == versioned_hash

    # Verify KZG proof with z and y in big endian format
    assert verify_kzg_proof(commitment, z, y, proof)

    # Return FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB and BLS_MODULUS as padded 32 byte big endian values
    return Bytes(U256(FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB).to_be_bytes32() + U256(BLS_MODULUS).to_be_bytes32())
```

The precompile MUST reject non-canonical field elements (i.e. provided field elements MUST be strictly less than `BLS_MODULUS`).

### Execution layer validation

On the execution layer, the block validity conditions are extended as follows:

```python
def validate_block(block: Block) -> None:
    ...

    # check that the excess blob gas was updated correctly
    assert block.header.excess_blob_gas == calc_excess_blob_gas(block.parent.header)

    blob_gas_used = 0

    for tx in block.transactions:
        ...

        # modify the check for sufficient balance
        max_total_fee = tx.gas * tx.max_fee_per_gas
        if get_tx_type(tx) == BLOB_TX_TYPE:
            max_total_fee += get_total_blob_gas(tx) * tx.max_fee_per_blob_gas
        assert signer(tx).balance >= max_total_fee

        ...

        # add validity logic specific to blob txs
        if get_tx_type(tx) == BLOB_TX_TYPE:
            # there must be at least one blob
            assert len(tx.blob_versioned_hashes) > 0

            # all versioned blob hashes must start with VERSIONED_HASH_VERSION_KZG
            for h in tx.blob_versioned_hashes:
                assert h[0] == VERSIONED_HASH_VERSION_KZG

            # ensure that the user was willing to at least pay the current blob base fee
            assert tx.max_fee_per_blob_gas >= get_base_fee_per_blob_gas(block.header)

            # keep track of total blob gas spent in the block
            blob_gas_used += get_total_blob_gas(tx)

    # ensure the total blob gas spent is at most equal to the limit
    assert blob_gas_used <= MAX_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK

    # ensure blob_gas_used matches header
    assert block.header.blob_gas_used == blob_gas_used

```
