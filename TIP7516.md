## Abstract

Add a `BLOBBASEFEE (0x4a)` instruction that returns the value of the blob base-fee of the current block it is executing in. It  returns the blob base-fee as per [TIP-4844](./tip-4844.md).


## Motivation

The intended use case would be for contracts to get the value of the blob base-fee. This feature enables blob-data users to programmatically account for the blob gas price, eg:

- Allow rollup contracts to trustlessly account for blob data usage costs.
- Blob gas futures can be implemented based on it which allows for blob users to smooth out data blob costs.

## Specification

Add a `BLOBBASEFEE` instruction with opcode `0x4a`, with gas cost `2`.

| Op   | Input | Output | Cost |
|------|-------|--------|------|
| 0x4a | 0     | 1      | 2    |

`BLOBBASEFEE` returns the result of the `get_blob_gasprice(header) -> int` function as defined in [TIP-4844 §Gas accounting](./tip-4844.md#gas-accounting).

## Rationale

### Gas cost

The value of the blob base-fee is needed to process data-blob transactions. That means its value is already available before running the EVM code.
The instruction does not add extra complexity and additional read/write operations, hence the choice of `2` gas cost. 
## Backwards Compatibility

There are no known backward compatibility issues with this instruction.


## Test Cases

### Nominal Case

Assume calling `get_blob_gasprice(header)` (as defined in [TIP-4844 §Gas accounting](./tip-4844.md#gas-accounting)) on the current block's header returns `7 sun`:
`BLOBBASEFEE` should push the value `7` (left padded byte32) to the stack.

Bytecode: `0x4900` (`BLOBBASEFEE, STOP`)

| Pc | Op          | Cost | Stack | RStack |
|----|-------------|------|-------|--------|
| 0  | BLOBBASEFEE | 2    | []    | []     |
| 1  | STOP        | 0    | [7]   | []     |

Output: 0x

Consumed gas: `2`


## Security Considerations

The value of the blob base-fee is not sensitive and is publicly accessible in the block header. There are no known security implications with this instruction.
